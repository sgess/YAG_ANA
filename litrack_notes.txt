FACET TO LITRACK NOTES

9/20 23:15
Finished first state to amp and phase function, need to translate to LIT file

00:00
comparing to MDW's FACET_lit file. found issue in LI10-LI11. It seems that he is missing KLYS:LI10:81 and I am missing KLYS:LI11:31

01:00
OK, KLYS:LI10:81 does not exist, that is where the S10 chicken is. KLYS:LI11:31 also does not exist. There is a solenoid there but I don't know what it does.

To do:
1. Energy profiles for:
	-machine no feedback
	-machine with state feedback and lem
	-machine with my feedback and lem
9/25 00:00
Ultimately decided to plot machine profiles for
	-state no lem
	-state with lem
	-my calculated feedback and LEM

2. Comparison of full machine vs. sectored linac
03:15
	-averaged sector phase
	-did energy profile by sector, matches profile by klystron

3. Make the sector LiTrack deck
	-works and matches by klystron deck

4. Make compression parameters global
	-also need a record of all parameters used (make new file param.txt)

5. Go back to original Litrack deck and investigate effect of sectoring and changing final energy
	-reoptimize parameters for different energies?
