FACET TO LITRACK NOTES

9/20 23:15
Finished first state to amp and phase function, need to translate to LIT file

00:00
comparing to MDW's FACET_lit file. found issue in LI10-LI11. It seems that he is missing KLYS:LI10:81 and I am missing KLYS:LI11:31

01:00
OK, KLYS:LI10:81 does not exist, that is where the S10 chicken is. KLYS:LI11:31 also does not exist. There is a solenoid there but I don't know what it does.

To do:
1. Energy profiles for:
	-machine no feedback
	-machine with state feedback and lem
	-machine with my feedback and lem
9/25 00:00
Ultimately decided to plot machine profiles for
	-state no lem
	-state with lem
	-my calculated feedback and LEM

2. Comparison of full machine vs. sectored linac
03:15
	-averaged sector phase
	-did energy profile by sector, matches profile by klystron

3. Make the sector LiTrack deck
	-works and matches by klystron deck

9/26 20:15
4. Make compression parameters global
	-also need a record of all parameters used (make new file param.txt)

5. Go back to original Litrack deck and investigate effect of sectoring and changing final energy
	-reoptimize parameters for different energies?

Comments on LEM and chirp:

-My attempts to LEM have thus far only considered the energy at S10 and not the total chirp. attempts to LEM need to respect both
-In reality, do we always replace klystrons in one sector with another in the same sector?
-Do we make BLMs after S10?

The chirp for Hogan's original file is -3.0536 GeV for -21.2 phase and a 2-10 gain of 8.444 GeV. 
Before S10, the peak current is 0.339 kA, the sigma is 1449 and the fwhm is 3.232.
After S10, the peak current is 6.253 kA, the sigma is 58.000 and the fwhm is 123.000.
At S20, the peak current is 22.857 kA, the sigma is 14.163 and the fwhm is 26.319 for a final energy of 23 GeV.
At S20, the peak current is 21.410 kA, the sigma is 15.377 and the fwhm is 30.939 for a final energy of 20.35 GeV.

If you let LiTrack set the 2-10 gain, the chirp is -3.0293.
Before S10, the peak current is 0.339 kA, the sigma is 1449 and the fwhm is 3.232.
After S10, the peak current is 6.958 kA, the sigma is 51.654 and the fwhm is 114.304.
At S20, the peak current is 21.716 kA, the sigma is 15.052 and the fwhm is 29.827 for a final energy of 23 GeV.
At S20, the peak current is 19.039 kA, the sigma is 19.723 and the fwhm is 39.723 for a final energy of 20.35 GeV.

Take home: going from design values of -3.0536 chirp and 23 GeV final energy to -3.0293 chirp and 20.35 GeV, I_p goes from 22.857 to 19.039 and sigma goes from 14.163 to 19.723.
